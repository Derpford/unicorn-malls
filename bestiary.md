# Shade Bestiary

## A note on large numbers of enemies
You can combine enemies of the same type into groups to aid in designing larger encounters. A group of enemies has the collective HP and SP of all its members, and multiplies the numerical effects of its abilities by the number of enemies in the group, but only takes one action per turn.

Note down the number of enemies in the group. Each time the group loses HP equal to the base HP of that enemy type, or SP equal to the base SP of that enemy type, reduce the number by 1 (because the party has killed one of the enemies). If the number of enemies is reduced to zero, they are all defeated, *regardless of how much HP or SP they may have left*.

For example, a group of 3 Caspers would have 12 HP, 6 SP, and would do 3 SP damage and 3 HP damage with Boo! and Chill Touch respectively. If the party were to deal 4 HP damage, the group would be whittled down to 2 Caspers, and would do 2 damage with each of those attacks. Dealing 2 SP damage to the Caspers would then reduce their number to 1. Upon doing another 4 HP or 2 SP damage to the remaining Casper, it will perish and the Caspers as a whole will be defeated, even though it would have HP and SP left afterward.

By using this mechanic, you can simplify large encounters, scale enemies up to match the players' power, and do so in a way that makes the players feel like they *are* getting more powerful.
