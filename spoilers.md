# What's Really Going On?

Listen, I don't have much time. I know some things drift up to upper levels of the Malls, the Shades carry things around sometimes, so I'm hoping this journal makes it up there. *I'm* not gonna make it back. My escape route's cut off, I didn't find any Nut Water or whatever it's called, and I don't have the resources to fight that thing.

It's just sitting there. *Taunting* me.

So, here's what I've figured out.

## The Colour And The Shades
There's a place deep, deep down in the Malls. I'm calling it The Colour, because everything's so goddamn colorful. There is no shade of gray in sight. Things don't stay the *SAME* color, but they don't stop being colorful. The shades stop pretending to be human when you get this deep, and I think it's because this is their natural habitat. There's a lot of really powerful ones down here, too. I thought I was hot shit, and I kinda was, but strength without skill is a good way to break a leg.

This place shifts and changes when you aren't looking. The sun shines in colors that shouldn't exist, in a place that shouldn't exist. I saw a unicorn. I ran away, because that thing HAD to be a shade, and I can only imagine the kind of twisted shit a unicorn-shaped shade will do.

Some of them tried talking to me, too. I know, you're not supposed to listen, but I did. It told me it wanted to help me. It knew about that cul-de-sac, even though I'd forgotten about it. It said that place was down here, just like everything else I've lost. My favorite action figure? It's down here somewhere. The model kit that one of my friends broke one day? It's waiting for me to finish it. My ex-girlfriend? She can be here, too. Scared the shit out of me. Once I'd killed that thing, I started thinking, though, and I think I know what their deal is.

They eat memories. That's why they attack your mind. They're trying to suck the memories out of your head. That's why, when you feel yourself snap, it's so easy to just *forget* a part of yourself and pull yourself together. It's not a trauma response, it's a digestion mechanism. They want to show you things from your past because that sets off your memories--brings them to the surface, so that it's easier to pluck them out.

I'm pretty sure the Psyches are part of it, too. I mean, you can only use them when you're inside the Malls, right? Where there's lots of shades. And the deeper you go, the more Prisms you find, the easier it is to get better Psyches. And we all know that Psyches run on memories--the same memories the shades eat. Psyches aren't our defense mechanism against them; they're like some kind of enzyme that makes our memories easier to access.

## Nostalgia
I'm starting to think that the appearance of the Colour inside the Malls isn't a coincidence, either. Think about it: the shades, and everything we find in here, seem to be designed to inspire *nostalgia*. A feeling of longing for a time that happened before. And, hey, it's no secret that a lot of corporate types have been leaning harder and harder on nostalgia over the years. What do you think they'd do if they found a pocket universe made of nostalgia?

They'd try to mine it. Drill it out like a goddamn oil well. Who cares if people get hurt? If they die? If you could harness the feelings the shades give you--the emptiness that *needs* to be filled with something, the desperate longing for comfort and familiarity--you'd have a money printer. Why make a new movie if you can get people addicted to the ones you've already made? What better way to make a product sell than to make people psychologically dependent on it? I bet even the memory-loss got turned into a profit angle: sell someone a movie ticket, then make them forget they saw the movie and sell them the same ticket next week.

So I guess when the shades started breaking out, they tried to keep it all quiet as long as they could, and then it got to a point where nobody wanted to go into the Malls. Except, y'know, *us*. But who gives a shit about us? I bet you're broke, just like me. No job, no life, all you can do is dig through the junkyard of society and hope you can find some kinda meaning in there. We were never the target audience for the Malls. We can't afford *real* nostalgia, just the hand-me-down stuff.
