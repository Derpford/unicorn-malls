# Unicorn Malls
The old mall is dead.

The new mall hasn't been built yet.

Your nostalgia for a time that does not exist, neither alive nor un-alive, continues forever.

Now is the time of untrue things, of sweet lies that consume your soul and dread echoes that hurt to listen to.

Now is the time of unicorns.

# Character Creation

First, answer this question: What have you lost?

The Malls hold the promise of returning it to you.

Next, write down three of your cherished memories. Mark a +3 next to the most important one, a +2 next to the second most valuable, and a +1 next to the third most cherished. These are your Mementos, and they power your Psyche (you'll learn how to use it later). Leave plenty of room for more.

Write down something you carry with you that can be used to bash, cut, or otherwise inflict physical harm on things. Write a +1 next to it. This is your weapon. People from your generation know that you have to fight sometimes.

Pick one item from the Starting Items list. Someone brought snacks for everyone.

Pick two items from the Starting Psyche list. These are powers that you gain upon entering the Malls.

Write down "Health: 20", "Sanity: 20", and "Vitality: 40". These are your starting Health, Sanity, and Vitality caps. 

# Fighting
The shades are not friendly. Do not trust them. Do not believe anything a shade tells you. You should probably just kill them on sight.

Here's how to do it:

## Starting a Fight
When you're wandering the Malls, the GM may tell you that there are enemies in the next section of the Mall. **You can always see enemies coming**. They're incapable of hiding, even in their fake-human guises. The GM will also tell you **where they are**, which has implications about what you might find when you beat them.

Continuing in that direction **will start a fight** if the shades are hostile. (They usually are.)

## Turn Order
Each round of combat consists of alternating turns. One of your party members acts, then one enemy acts. When everyone has taken a turn, the next round starts. You can take turns in any order you like, so long as everyone only takes one turn per round.

## Health, Vitality, Stability, and Mementos
There are four really important things to keep an eye on when fighting.

Your **Health** is a general measure of how hurt you are right now. Make no mistake: shades might be some kind of messed-up mental constructs, but they *CAN* hurt you and it *IS* real injury. If you run out of Health, that means you've taken a serious hit that you can't ignore, and you'll **collapse** at the end of your next turn. **Any source of healing between now and your next turn will keep you in the fight**. Once you've collapsed, though, **it takes actual medical attention** to get you back on your feet.

Your **Vitality** is a measure of how long you can keep going in the long term. **At the end of each fight, you can recover Health by spending Vitality,** at a rate of 1 point of Vitality for 2 points of Health. You can also **Refresh your Tapped Mementos,** at a rate of 1 Vitality per Memento. Many healing items give enhanced effects if you use them on your Vitality instead, but bear in mind that you'll want to have some on hand to heal up during fights. It's easier to munch on a burger when you're not being chased by monsters. Running out of Stamina is not an immediate concern, but it *DOES* mean that you need to be more careful, and you should seriously consider retreating to the outside world.

Your **Sanity** is a measure of how good you feel about yourself, how grounded you are to reality, that kinda thing. Shades can attack your Sanity, and some other things can cost SP as part of their effect. When you run out of SP, you experience a brief existential crisis called a **Crash**--tormented by the strange reality you're exploring, you must choose how to cope:
- You can Burn some Mementos, discarding a part of yourself that isn't strong enough. Burn a number of Mementos equal to your Burn Level. Afterward, Increase your Burn Level by 1.
- You can tear at your skin, losing half your current Health to kick yourself back into the fight with adrenaline and self-harm.
- You can lash out at an ally, dealing damage to them equal to your regular weapon attack to feel like you're doing *something* about your pain.
- You can curl up in a ball and sob uncontrollably, becoming unable to fight.

After Crashing, you recover all SP.

Your **Mementos** are more complicated than the number associated with them; they're the core memories that drive who you are. They're also, apparently, the shades' favorite snack. On the plus side, the strange reality of the Malls gives you access to a powerful way of fighting back: Psyche. The thing about Psyche is that it's literally powered by your memories. During combat, you can 'tap' a Memento to use one of your Psyches, applying a bonus to the effect based on the rank of the Memento you used. (Look over the Psyche list for more info.) Mementos have three levels of 'used':
- Tapped: You've used this Memento once. You can refresh ("untap") it at the end of the fight, by spending Vitality.
- Exhausted: You can tap a Tapped memento to Exhaust it, and some Psyches may require you to Exhaust a Memento outright. Exhausted Mementos are refreshed when you leave the Mall.
- Burned: Some very powerful Psyches can Burn a Memento, and you can also be forced to Burn a Memento as a result of running out of Stability. A Burned Memento is damaged to the point that you can only barely remember it, and cannot be used for anything unless you find a way to heal the wound.

## Actions
Each turn, you can do one of the following things:

### Smash Faces
Use your weapon to physically harm a shade or other enemy. Roll a number of d6es equal to your weapon's rank; do that much damage to target enemy. This does not cost any resources other than your turn, making it a good option for when you don't want to use anything else. The randomness can be a boon or a curse, especially early on.

### Use an Item
Pick an item from the party's stash and trigger its in-combat effects. You can choose who receives the effects, if applicable. You should communicate with your friends about when and how to use items, because they're gone once you use them.

### Defend
Block, dodge, or otherwise reduce incoming damage. You can choose to spend up to 5 Vitality to recover Health, as well.

### Use a Psyche
Trigger any Psyche on your sheet that you meet the activation requirements for. You'll usually have to Tap a Memento for this, and the rank of that Memento will affect the results.

#### Reaction Psyches
Some Psyches will have the word 'Reaction' in their trigger conditions. These Psyches can be used on any turn, but typically still require you to Tap a Memento or pay some other kind of cost.

## Ending a Fight
A fight is over when everybody who would oppose you is either dead or surrendering. At the end of the fight, the GM will tell you what you found. Generally, **you WILL find something,** but it won't always be something immediately useful or valuable. Sometimes it's just cash, sometimes it's items, if you're lucky it's both.

Once the fight's over, remember to Refresh all the Tapped Mementos you have. You don't get to refresh Exhausted Mementos, though.

# The Malls
It's not quite clear when it happened, but it was some time after the Malls started dying. Their decaying husks, still populated with hopeful small-time stores and big-name brands that can throw good money after bad, became host to something otherworldly. People tried to ignore it, the same way they ignored so many other things that were distasteful and upsetting, but eventually there were one too many incidents, one too many trophy wives found dead with a smile on their faces, one too many happy families mysteriously vanished.

Now the Malls really are dead. Condemned, the product left on the shelves, the employees sometimes left to fend for themselves after the doors were locked. Fortunately for you, the idiot who invented the lock has never heard of the hammer. Whether you're a rebellious teenager looking for adventure, or an adult looking for valuables, you've found a way in. And you don't remember this place having a basement...

## Surface Level
On the upper floors, things are mostly as they were before. Stores lay abandoned--either locked up tight, or already looted. Here is where the first signs of real danger appear. There are no security guards, nor alarm systems to call in the police--the cops don't dare venture in here. Instead, you'll start to find surreal *things*. 

Sometimes they look like people, from a distance, but get up close, and the true form quickly springs out upon you. Scintillating colors, cartoonish shapes, absurd voices--they're like something out of a demented cartoon. I've seen people go mad, you know; the shades took their minds. Saw one guy just walk off into the mall, a great big grin on his face. When I came back a week later, I saw a shade that reminded me of him.

## Tunnels
Take a staircase down and you'll find a network of nearly-endless tunnels. Some of these had to be part of the real world, but some of the tunnels make no sense--looping in on themselves, running to dead ends in places they shouldn't, and so on. The pipes are labeled with Hot and Cold Water, Steam, and Electricity, but also Hope, Fear, and Longing. There are more shades here, and they're a little tougher, they shine a little brighter--I think it's because they don't like how dark it is down there.

## The Deeper Levels
They say that as you go further down, the places you go get weirder. Sometimes you can see the sky despite being hundreds of feet underground. Sometimes you end up in someplace that feels fake, like some alien species saw a picture of a bathhouse or a hotel and decided that that's what human places look like.

# Psyches
## Starting Psyches
### Burst 1
Tap a Memento: Pick a target. Deal 2 damage to that target, then do it again for each rank of the Memento you tapped.

*A flash of multicolored light that seems to burn away parts of the target. Some people hear a saxophone sting when it lands.*

### Heal 1
Tap a Memento: Pick an ally. Heal 2 HP to them, then do it again for each rank of the Memento you tapped. You can use this Psyche outside of combat.

*A soothing warmth that takes away your pain.*

### Pump Up
Tap a Memento: Each ally's next attack does additional damage equal to the rank of the Memento you tapped.

*The spirit of cameraderie. Used right, this power can turn a group of friends into an unstoppable force of mass destruction.*

### Shout
Tap a Memento: Target enemy takes damage equal to the rank of the Memento you tapped. Its next attack has its damage reduced by the rank of the Memento you tapped.

*A bold battlecry. Or maybe just a really loud yell. Either way, it startles your enemies and makes them think twice about hitting you.*

### Ward 1
Tap a Memento: Until the start of your next turn, any damage allies would take is reduced by the rank of the Memento you tapped.

*Brace for impact.*

### Scan
Tap a Memento: Pick a number of targets equal to the rank of the Memento you tapped. You learn their stats and abilities. Target ally recovers SP equal to the rank of the Mementos you tapped.

*Some say that man was not meant to know these things...but the only thing men fear is the unknown, and once it becomes the known, there's nothing to fear.*

## Rank 2 Psyches
You can gain these with a Prism if you have at least one Starting Psyche.

### Burst 2
Tap a Memento: Pick two targets. They each take 2 damage, then take 2 damage again for each rank of the Memento you tapped.

*With a little practice, and good timing, you can catch two of them in the same blast.*

### Heal 2
Tap a Memento: All allies heal 1 HP, then heal another 1 HP for each rank of the Memento you tapped.

*A calming aura radiates out from you. Maybe it's not that strong, but if you've got a lot of friends, it's surprisingly good.*

### Stand Tall
Tap a Memento: Enemies have to target you until the end of the round. You recover HP equal to 2 times the rank of the Memento you tapped at the end of the round.

*Dare them to hit you. Just hope that they hit your body and not your mind.*

### Sneaky Jab
Tap a Memento: Pick an enemy that hasn't attacked you this round. They take damage equal to the rank of the Memento you tapped, then they take that damage again whenever someone else hits them until either they're dead or you use Sneaky Jab again.

*An afterimage of your body that hits them from behind whenever they're distracted. It's smiling. What does it know that you don't?*

### Gutsy
Reaction: When your HP would be reduced to 0, tap a Memento. At the start of your next turn, your HP is set to the rank of that Memento.

*It'll take more than that to put you down.*

## Rank 5 Psyches
You can gain these with a Prism if you have at least one Rank 4 Psyche.

### Ormagoden
Burn a Memento: All enemies perish. Gain SP and HP equal to the rank of the Memento you burned. If you burned a Memento at rank 3 or higher: Gain a Honed Steel.

*Visions of chromium-plated boiling metal plague your mind.*
